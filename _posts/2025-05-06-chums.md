# Friends

Should our Grey District Councillors all be such good friends? Although recognizing the need for debate to be civil and productive it does seem that if you tune into the GDC council meetings there is a lack of what we might call hard-hitting debate or definite opposition to each other's ideas or policy.

Has Grey District Council put the need for a constant display of unity above the need for effective debate and an effective opposition to ideas? Although realizing that smaller local body politics with people from the same small communities may make dissent difficult - dissent is still an important part of democracy.

A robust democracy and local council isn't just about the Mayor in power, or the Chief Executive appointed; it relies on Councillors who will speak up in opposition to ideas/policies that are wrong or ill-conceived. 

Councillors who oppose the Chief Executive or the Mayor acts as a crucial check on the power of local government. They scrutinize policies, hold the Chief Executive accountable for their actions, and expose any incompetence. Without this check, GDC could become autocratic, ignoring the needs and concerns of the people. With no one to question their decisions - disastrous results are likely.

Vigorous debate leads to better-informed policies. Speaking out in opposition offers alternative perspectives, highlighting potential flaws and suggesting improvements. This process of constructive criticism refines policy and ensures it better serves the public interest. It allows for the expression of dissenting opinions and prevents the dominance of a single viewpoint or relying solely on the advice of the Chief Executive.

It could be argued that a Grey District Council which had more dissenting voices would increase public participation in local democracy. A lively political debate fuelled by dissenting opinions could increase public engagement and participation. Citizens become more informed and involved when they see a real contest of ideas. This leads to a more active and participatory democracy.

Do we need more hard-hitting debate and dissent - rather than the usual displays of hand-wringing over rate rises?
