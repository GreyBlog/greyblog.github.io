# Library Flip-Flop

We at Greyblog always like to congratulate GDC when they do the right thing. And there is no doubt that not using a CCO to build and manage the New Library is the right thing.

The question we have at Greyblog is Why did it take the Mayor and Councillors so long to realise this? And why didnthey don.

It seems that the ratepayers did know what they were talking about, and it was the Councillors who were wrong.

The Councils flip-flop on using a CCO shows a deeper malaise at the heart of Grey District Council. That is a Mayor and Council who refuse to listen to good advise, they then have to reverse previous bad decisions. 

Without mentioning names we can all think of the example of a certain persons appointment, subsequent pay rise and a Council that refused to acknowledge the problem until to late.

This surely meets the definition of a Dysfunctional Council
