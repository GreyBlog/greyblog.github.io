# Conduct Unbecoming

In the realm of politics, integrity and accountability are paramount. A code of conduct serves as a vital framework that outlines the ethical standards and expectations for our Mayor and Councillors. A code of conduct is not merely a set of rules; it is a commitment to uphold the values of democracy and public service.

It is a serious document and commitment so why would our Deputy Mayor Alan Gibson think it is so unimportant

In a recent Facebook dialogue Alan seemed to indicate that he felt he wasn't bound by GDC's code of conduct.





𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗽𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗮 𝟮𝟳% 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀? This is a good question and one that our Councillors and Mayor should have asked before beginning such an audacious project.

The facts as we can ascertain them -

At the moment the Library costs ratepayers 2.55% of council revanue so for every $100 of council revenue $2.55 goes to the library.

With the new library it will cost 3.24% of councils total revenue so for every $100 of revenue $3.24 goes to the library

The difference between $2.55 and $3.24 is 27% - so at least a 27% increase in Library running costs.
(Based on the GDC press release.)

If we include the fact of an average 13% increase in rates then the actual increase in cost is likely to be more than 27% as council total revenue will have risen significantly.
That is why GDC should provide the actual dollar amounts so we can be sure how much the New Library is going to cost us going forward? This isn't a one-off cost, these are ongoing costs.

These are costs that would have been known before embarking on the project and yet the Mayor and Councillors led many people to believe that there would be no increase in operating costs - despite the truth being that there were always going to be significant increases in the annual cost to ratepayers.

Of course it is nice to have a new library but the question every ratepayer and Councillor should be asking - 𝙖𝙩 𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙩 𝙙𝙤 𝙬𝙚 𝙣𝙚𝙚𝙙 𝙖 𝙣𝙚𝙬 𝙡𝙞𝙗𝙧𝙖𝙧𝙮?

It seems we now have a Council addicted to spending - unable to find savings or to live within budget? 

(In the absence of any further information from GDC we believe these figures and calculations to be accurate if we receive more data we will happily update the blog-post)
