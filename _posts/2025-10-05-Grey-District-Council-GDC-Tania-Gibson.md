# Tania: Terrific or Terrible

It is perhaps inevitable that every Mayor in every small town of New Zealand / Aotearoa will eventually polarize voters. Tania Gibson, the Mayor of the Grey District, has drawn both support and criticism during her tenure. While some view her as a friendly leader aiming for progress, others highlight a series of contentious decisions that have stirred controversy within the community.

So is it Tania the Terrific? Or Tania the Terrible? Perhaps it is just Tania?

One of the most significant controversies surrounding Tania's administration has been related to rate increases. A recent public outcry erupted when residents expressed their dissatisfaction with the council's decision to substantialy raise rates after years of previously large rate rises. During a council meeting, Councillors were seen laughing when questioned about the backlash, which many residents found disrespectful. This incident not only fuelled public anger but also raised questions about the council's sensitivity to the needs of its constituents. Tania responded quickly with a fullsome apology but damage was still done. 

The deeper causes of these rate rises have also seen much public commentary. 

Tania oversaw a Council that was responsible for the appointment of the previous CEO and giving a 42% pay rise at a time when his capabilities were in question. Tania supported the CEO in an enormously expensive Council restructure that seems to have largely failed and caused enormous staff turmoil and demoralization. The continued support of the CEO and his restructure even after the effects were becoming quite clear did Tania no favours.

A series of budget mishaps and large budget blowouts including a $6 million budget hole, have not helped ratepayers, nor has a growing Council debt. 

A problematic infrastructure programme with many residents believing that these projects were not well-researched or aligned with the community's actual needs. 

Finally, significant staff increases since the previous Mayor left office. 

All of these decisions supported by Tania and her Councillors have contributed to large rate increases.

Tania's Gibson's response to these crises and the rate rises has been to emphasize her commitment to the community and her vision for Greymouth's future. Tania and her Councillors have been quick to blame external factors, previous Councils and even the weather. But the debates continue to linger.

Despite all these crises Tania remains popular with a core group of supporters, who will point to her affable nature and strong links to the community. With her sole mayoral challenger being the enigmatic Richard Osmaston, it seems likely she will win another term, although voters can be fickle.

As Greymouth moves forward, addressing these crises will be crucial for rebuilding trust and ensuring that the communityâ€™s needs are adequately met, thereby fostering a more transparent, inclusive and responsive governance model.

Perhaps whether Tania turns out to be Terrific, Terrible or just Tania will be decided in the next Mayoral cycle if she gets re-elected.

Whichever way you plan to vote in this election either for change or the status quo, do make sure you vote. Our democracy depends on you having a say - and if that isn't enough incentive then remember the people you vote for will be setting your rates for the years to come.
