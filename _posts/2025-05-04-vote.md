# Don't Forget to Vote

We at Greyblog want to encourage everybody on the West Coast to make sure they enrol to vote. And vote at the next Local Government elections between 9th September and 11th October 2025.

Remember this is a vote for the people who will set your rates. If you are concerned about the amount of rates that are being demanded by your council? If you are concerned about how much rent you are paying because your landlord has passed on the cost of rate rises? Then this is your opportunity to send a very clear message.
