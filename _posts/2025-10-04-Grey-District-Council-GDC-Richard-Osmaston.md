# Riddle of Richard Osmaston

Apart from all the Controversy surrounding explosive rate increases and behaviour of Councillors the Mayoral Contest in the Grey District has been a rather quiet and civilized affair.

The current Mayor has largely kept her head down avoiding the fallout from a tsunami of bad news. Rising Rates, Growing Debt, Councillors Expletive Filled Rants, and the Infamous Laughing Incident.

The Mayoral Challenger - Richard Osmaston - is seemingly the Invisible Man - rarely making any kind of comment on current events or doing any real politicking. Apart from his name on the ballot paper and a few generic who is standing pieces in the newspaper he is largely unseen and unheard.  

So who is Richard Osmaston our would be Grey District Mayor and is there a riddle to be solved.


The Facts First -

Richard has lived in St Arnaud for over twenty years, he is a retired DC10 pilot and licensed engineer, a lifelong small-holder/farmer, currently teaching aero engineering. 

Richard is standing for the following positions: Mayor - Grey District Council, Mayor - Buller District Council, Mayor - Tasman District Council, Mayor - Nelson City Council, Mayor - Westland District Council, Lakes-Murchison General Ward.

Richard's Philosophy

This is a philosophy that is so outrageous it has garnered a great deal of commentary from voters. In short Richard believes that we can build a society without the burden of having money. 

In his own words.

"I have researched and promoted a money-free Resource Based Economy alternative to our catastrophic money-based system for over 15 years. This RBE system embraces all advances in human development, knowledge, technological progress and in our understanding of Earth's socio-ecological realities, most of which were not previously known. We have an unprecedented opportunity to begin the process of introducing this new paradigm. It's at least worth a closer look. Isn't it?"

Richard's vision challenges traditional financial structures, aiming to create a community where resources are shared and accessible to all, rather than being driven by profit.

Richard's ideas on sustainability may find some support amongst the environmentalists in our community, and he is certainly a passionate believer in his cause.

We suspect many Grey District Voters will be put off by Richard's more outlandish ideas, but for those who want a change from the status quo he is the only game in town. 

Whichever way you plan to vote in this election either for change or the status quo, do make sure you vote. Our democracy depends on you having a say - and if that isn't enough incentive then remember the people you vote for will be setting your rates for the years to come
