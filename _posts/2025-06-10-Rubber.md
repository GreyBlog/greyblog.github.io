# Rubber Stamp

The Rubber Stamp Award for 2025 goes to Grey District Councillors and Mayor.

The council received 166 submissions on its draft plan, and just under 30 people presented to councillors.

Yet given the speed of their decision-making it is implausible to believe that a single Councillor went into that meeting seriously considering a possible reduction to their outrageous rates forecast.

Ratepayers now face the daunting prospect of a series of double-digit rate increases "rates increase is to be no greater than 13.7% for year 1, 10.09% for year 2, 10.31% for year 3 and not exceed 11.6% for the remaining years." (from the council LTP)

If you are a ratepayer this is what your Councillors and Mayor voted for.
